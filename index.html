        <h1>Motivational Speaker</h1>
        <p>If you asked me what the most valuable lesson in life is,
            I would say, "wasting time", wasting time in doing what you love.
            The only certainty we know of, is that time passes,
            the very same way that candles, eventually, burn out,
            how leaves fall in autumn and all good things come to an end.
            Enjoy it while it lasts, Efficency should never be a factor 
            when doing what you truly enjoy.</p>
        <p>My name is Rocco Turazza,
            I never had fatasys of becoming a motivational speaker as a child,
            the idea of speaking in public never particularly appealed to me,
            not to mention, confidence was never my strong suit.
            I hemorrhaged at the age of 8, Looking back on this, now,
            I can safely, without a shadow of a doubt, say, 
            that was the biggest hurdle I ever had to overcome. 
            Calling into question everything that I knew and all I dedicated
             my self to, until that point.</p>

        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Hi, still, Rocco Turazza. My love for art naturally unfolded into what it is now. 
            This process began when I was discharged from hospital and moved back home, I was about nine,
            Exploring this, thing, that is in the way of me, doing what I love. It's called ATAXIA, 
            a neurologic desorder, affecting cordination in all areas.
